    <p>
      This is a paragraph. We often separate a long set of sentences with
      vertical spaces to make the text easier to read. Browsers ignore vertical
      white spaces and render all the text as one single set of sentences. To
      force the browser to add vertical spacing, wrap the paragraphs you want to
      separate with the paragraph tag
